📌 Project Title:
OS Scheduler Simulator

🧠 Description:
A desktop application that simulates multiple CPU scheduling algorithms in Operating Systems. Users can generate or load process data, apply scheduling algorithms, and compare their performance using visual tools like Gantt charts and bar graphs.

⚙️ Technologies Used:
Python

PyQt5 (for GUI)

Matplotlib (for Gantt & comparison charts)

NumPy (for statistical generation of processes)

🧪 Key Features:
Simulation of four scheduling algorithms:

First Come First Serve (FCFS)

Non-Preemptive Priority

Round Robin

Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)

Process generator using normal and Poisson distributions

Gantt Chart visualization for each algorithm

Detailed performance metrics: average waiting and turnaround times

Comparison chart of all algorithms

Export results to CSV and PDF

Clean, dark-themed GUI with intuitive controls

🎯 What I Learned:
Implementing and comparing OS scheduling algorithms

GUI development with PyQt5

Data visualization using Matplotlib

Designing user-friendly interfaces and exporting data effectively
